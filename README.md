## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a dashboard that predicts and explains insurance charges for individuals based on their demographics, health history, lifestyle habits, and other factors. The dashboard is built to help users understand patterns in insurance costs and identify the high-risk groups that lead to increased medical expenses.

 ## Dataset Overview

#### The dataset includes 65,535 records and covers the following fields:

-	<ins>age:</ins> Age group (Young Adult, Adult, Mid Age, Old Age)

-	<ins>gender:</ins> Male / Female

-	<ins>bmi:</ins> Body Mass Index with categories (Normal, Overweight, Obesity)

-	<ins>smoker:</ins> Smoking status (Yes/No)

-	<ins>region:</ins> Region of residence (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest)

-	<ins>medical_history:</ins> Known medical conditions (e.g., Diabetes, High BP)

-	<ins>family_medical_history:</ins> Family conditions (e.g., Heart Disease)

-	<ins>exercise_frequency:</ins> How often the person exercises

-	<ins>occupation:</ins> Job type (White Collar, Blue Collar, Student, etc.)

-	<ins>coverage_level:</ins> Insurance coverage type

-	<ins>charges:</ins> Medical insurance charges

## Visual Analysis Breakdown

#### 1. Effect of Age, BMI, and Smoking on Insurance Charges

-	Stacked Bar Chart segmented by BMI categories.

-	Age groups include: Young Adult, Adult, Mid Age, and Old Age.

###### Smoking and BMI show a visible influence:

-	Obesity and smoking increase charges notably.
-	Older individuals have higher average charges than younger age groups.

**2. Impact of Medical History, Gender, and Region on Charges**

-	Clustered Bar Chart grouped by region.

-	Shows how average charges vary across:

-	Different regions (Northeast showing highest charges).

-	Medical history types (e.g., people with known conditions are charged more).

-	Gender effects are embedded within the region bars.

**3. Impact of Coverage Level and Occupation on Insurance Charges**

######	100% Stacked Area Chart displays:

-	Charges broken down by occupation (White Collar, Blue Collar, etc.).

-	Coverage levels (e.g., higher coverage leads to higher charges).

-	White collar and unemployed groups show relatively higher charge values.

**4. Impact of Family Medical History & Exercise Habits on Charges**

#####	Column & Line Chart Combo:

-	Shows average charges based on family history (e.g., Heart Disease, Diabetes).

-	Line chart overlaid to display count of exercise frequency.

-	Indicates that even among people who exercise, family history still affects charges significantly.

## Key Insights

1.	Age and BMI are major contributors — Old Age and Obesity lead to higher average charges.

2.	Smoking has a strong effect across all age groups — charges are consistently higher.

3.	Individuals from the Northeast region have higher insurance charges, possibly due to lifestyle or healthcare cost differences.

4.	Medical history conditions such as Diabetes or High Blood Pressure lead to increased premiums.

5.	People with family history of diseases (like Heart Disease) incur higher charges, regardless of their own health.

6.	Exercise helps but doesn’t fully negate the influence of genetics or medical history.

7.	Occupation and Coverage Level together impact charges — those with premium coverage or in certain job sectors (like White Collar) have higher costs.

## Conclusion

This dashboard successfully highlights how demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors affect insurance pricing. By identifying the most impactful variables, it helps users understand what drives cost variation in health insurance and offers direction for risk mitigation.

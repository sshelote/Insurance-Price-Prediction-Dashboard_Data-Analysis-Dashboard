# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I created a Power BI dashboard to study what factors affect insurance prices, like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. I cleaned and prepared the data, built visuals to show patterns, and added filters for better analysis. This project helped me understand data better and improved my Power BI and data visualization skills.
